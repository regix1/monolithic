## Documentation

The documentation for the LanCache.net project can be found on [our website](http://www.lancache.net)

The specific documentation for this monolithic container is [here](http://lancache.net/docs/containers/monolithic/)

If you have any problems after reading the documentation please see [the support page](http://lancache.net/support/) before opening a new issue on github.

## Multi-Architecture Support

This image supports both **AMD64** and **ARM64** architectures. Docker will automatically pull the correct image for your platform.

Supported platforms:
- `linux/amd64` - Standard x86_64 servers and desktops
- `linux/arm64` - ARM-based systems (Raspberry Pi 4/5, Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton, etc.)

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured in your docker-compose.yml file:

### User and Group Configuration

- `PUID` - User ID for the cache process (default: 1000)
  - Set to a numeric UID to match your host user
  - Set to `nginx` to use the default nginx user without modification
- `PGID` - Group ID for the cache process (default: 1000)
  - Set to a numeric GID to match your host group
  - Set to `nginx` to use the default nginx group without modification

These are particularly useful when you need to match specific user/group permissions on your host system for the cache directories, especially when using NFS mounts.

### Cache Configuration

- `CACHE_INDEX_SIZE` - Size of the cache index (default: 500m)
- `CACHE_DISK_SIZE` - Maximum size of the disk cache (default: 1000g)
- `MIN_FREE_DISK` - Minimum free disk space to maintain (default: 10g)
- `CACHE_MAX_AGE` - Maximum age of cached content (default: 3560d)
- `CACHE_SLICE_SIZE` - Size of cache slices (default: 1m)

### Network Configuration

- `UPSTREAM_DNS` - DNS servers to use for upstream resolution (default: "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4")

### Nginx Configuration

- `NGINX_WORKER_PROCESSES` - Number of nginx worker processes (default: auto)
- `NGINX_LOG_FORMAT` - Log format to use (default: cachelog)
- `NGINX_LOG_TO_STDOUT` - Output nginx access logs to stdout for debugging (default: false)

### Timeout Configuration

- `NGINX_PROXY_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` - Proxy connection timeout (default: 300s)
- `NGINX_PROXY_SEND_TIMEOUT` - Proxy send timeout (default: 300s)
- `NGINX_PROXY_READ_TIMEOUT` - Proxy read timeout (default: 300s)
- `NGINX_SEND_TIMEOUT` - Send timeout (default: 300s)

### Permissions Configuration

- `SKIP_PERMS_CHECK` - Skip the permissions check entirely on startup (default: false)
  - Set to "true" to disable all permissions checking at startup
  - Useful when you know permissions are already correct or managed externally
- `FORCE_PERMS_CHECK` - Force full recursive permissions fix on startup (default: false)
  - Set to "true" if you encounter permission errors after changing PUID/PGID
  - Note: This will take a long time on large caches

The permissions check runs a fast check on startup and will warn if files have incorrect ownership. It will not block container startup. If you need to fix permissions, either:
1. Set `FORCE_PERMS_CHECK=true` to attempt fixing from within the container
2. Run `chown -R <PUID>:<PGID> /path/to/cache` on the host system

### Example docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  monolithic:
    image: ghcr.io/regix1/monolithic:latest
    environment:
      - PUID=1006
      - PGID=1006
      - CACHE_DISK_SIZE=2000g
      - NGINX_PROXY_READ_TIMEOUT=600s
      - UPSTREAM_DNS=1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
    volumes:
      - ./cache:/data/cache
      - ./logs:/data/logs
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## NFS Mount Considerations

When using NFS-mounted cache directories:

1. **Set PUID/PGID** to match the user/group that owns the NFS share
2. **Use Mapall** (not just Maproot) in your NFS server settings if you want all writes to use the same UID/GID
3. If you see "Operation not permitted" errors during permissions check, the NFS server may not allow ownership changes - fix permissions on the NFS server directly or use `SKIP_PERMS_CHECK=true`

## Building from Source

This image is self-contained and builds from the official `nginx:alpine` base image, which provides multi-architecture support. To build locally:

```bash
# Build for current architecture
docker build -t monolithic:local .

# Build for multiple architectures (requires buildx)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t monolithic:local .
```
